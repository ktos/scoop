# scoop

My Scoop bucket with some pretty old/very strange software.

Currently there are:

* diruse.exe, from Windows 2000 Resource Kit, not available at Microsoft's website anymore,
* whois client (x64 only), based on [https://packages.msys2.org/base/whois](MSYS2 version),
* uptime.exe, probably from Windows NT 4.0 Server Resource Kit, not available at Microsoft's website anymore.
